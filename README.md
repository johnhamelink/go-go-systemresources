Go-go-systemresources!
=====================

Fast &amp; Light System Resources and MPD monitor for wmfs2
-----------------------------------------------------------

This was my first dabble into the go language. It's a quick and simple
resources monitor that spits out the text needed to display some pretty
text and graphs. Go-go-systemresources also handles MPD, and I plan to
add in Spotify support via dbus at some point too!

Here's a screenshot of Go-go-systemresources in action on my machine (click on it for a better aspect ratio):
